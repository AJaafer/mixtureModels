# mixtureModels

Rcpp implementation for fitting Dirichlet Process Normal-Inverse-Wishart mixture models. 
We have implemented two MCMC moves:

* The collapsed Gibbs sampler
* The Sequentially Allocated Split-Merge sampler (Dahl 2003)

For a demonstration see this [toy example](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kasparmartens/mixtureModels/master/examples/clustering_toy.html).
